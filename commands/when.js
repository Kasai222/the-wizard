Obviously, this can be occasionally faulty, such as some NY banners getting moved to Thanksgiving, but it's the best we can do.\n__Precise time__ - if there's no time in either <#434188013401145354> or in the in-game announcements, then we don't know. Any information you find outside of those that doesn't list sources is either working off of an educated guess, or mistaken.\n\n__Common <x> examples include:__ GSSR, events, free SR tickets");
